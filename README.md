This repository contains the official implementation of ["Separate Anything You Describe"](https://audio-agi.github.io/Separate-Anything-You-Describe/AudioSep_arXiv.pdf).

We introduce AudioSep, a foundation model for open-domain sound separation with natural language queries. AudioSep demonstrates strong separation performance and impressive zero-shot generalization ability on numerous tasks such as audio event separation, musical instrument separation, and
speech enhancement. 

Check the demonstration examples in the [Demo Page](https://audio-agi.github.io/Separate-Anything-You-Describe/)!

We will be releasing the code & pre-training models & evaluation benchmark very soon! 

Please stay tuned for further updates and more details!
